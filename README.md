# LetItAllOut
### Preface
This is a simple app built with the purpose of showcasing my JavaScript and Firebase skills. The concept is: *an app where you can write anything and everything, but you are the only one that can see it.* Quite boring, I know.<br><br>
**The idea here is not the important thing. What is, is that I managed to become more confident with the way I used both technologies.**

### Nerdy stuff
I wanted to implement as many features as I could, so my web app contains the following:
- **Responsive design**: Although with not the best implementation of responsive design, the app will look great on all screens.
- **Authentication(Registration and Sign-in)**: Users are stored in Firebase Database
- **CRUD**: Users can create and delete their posts
- **AJAX**: The app uses AJAX calls to the database to update the content each user sees. **No reloading**

Things left to be wanted:
- There aren't any animations present, as I don't want to become a front-end developer and don't have those skills.
- The browser doesn't remember the user. I tried to fiddle around with Firebase but couldn't understand how this works.
- Routing needs to be implemented.

### Where can you see the app in action?
The app is available for use on GitHub Pages:(insert link here)
